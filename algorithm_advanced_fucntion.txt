advancedCountingsort(Passed orginalArraysize, minimum value, maximum value, an orginalArray)
	Define a range variable and assign subtraction of maximum value and minimum value
	Define a counterArray of size maximum value + 1 and initialize it with zero.
	Define a sortedArray of size orginalArraysize.

	Iterate through each element in orginalArray:
		Subtract minimum value from current element of orginalArray.
		Count the occurrences of each element in orginalArray and update Counter_Array accordingly.
	Iterate through each element in counterAray:
		Calculate the running sum of Counter_Array.
	Iterate through each element in orginalArray:
		Use orginalArray element as the index to decrement the count of the current element in Counter_Array.
		Use the decremented count as the index to place the current element with addition of current element of originalArray and minimum value in sortedArray.
